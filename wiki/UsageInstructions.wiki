= A simple application =

Since *pyprocessing* is not a full fledged IDE but merely a Python package, it must be imported at the beginning of your application: 

{{{
from pyprocessing import *
}}}

After the import, a default 100x100 pixel window is defined, on which the application may now draw using pyprocessing functions and regular Python code. For instance:

{{{
smooth()
for i in range(10):
    line(i*5+5,20,i*5+50,80)
}}}

The last instruction should be a call to the `run()` function: 

{{{
run()
}}}

This will finally exhibit the window (which was hidden until this point) and enter the event dispatching loop.

In case you're wondering, here's the complete script and the contents of the drawing:

    line(i*5+5,20,i*5+50,80)

run()
}}}
</tr>
</table>
