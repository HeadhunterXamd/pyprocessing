#summary What a typical pyprocessing application looks like

= Writing a pyprocessing application =

== Simple usage ==

Unlike [http://www.processing.org Processing], *pyprocessing* is not a full fledged IDE but 
merely a Python package. Thus, you must use your favorite text editor or Python 
IDE to write a regular Python program which imports the pyprocessing package. We suggest
doing it at the beginning of your application: 

{{{
from pyprocessing import *
}}}

After the import, a default 100x100 pixel window is defined, on which the application may now draw using pyprocessing functions and other Python commands. For instance:

{{{
smooth()
for i in range(10):
    line(i*5+5,20,i*5+50,80)
}}}

The last instruction should be a call to the `run()` function: 

{{{
run()
}}}

This will finally show the window (which was hidden until this point) and the application
will enter the event dispatching loop. In principle, `run()` does not return, but
you can terminate the application by typing the `ESC` key.

In case you're wondering, here's the complete script and the contents of the drawing:

<table>
<tr>
<td>

</td>
<td>
{{{
from pyprocessing import *

smooth()
for i in range(10):
    line(i*5+5,20,i*5+50,80)

run()
}}}
</td>
</tr>
</table>

== Changing the default window ==

As with Processing, the window size may be changed with the `size()` function.
It has two required arguments: the width and height of the desired window in
pixels. Thus,
{{{
size(200,200)
}}}
will open a 200x200 pixels window.

By default, pyprocessing windows are not resizable, since this is the
expected Processing behavior. You can, however, request a resizable window by
adding the keyword argument `resizable=True`:
{{{
size(200,200,resizable=True)
}}}
It is even possible to request a full screen window by using the keyword argument
`fullscreen=True`.

Pyprocessing will adjust the coordinate system to reflect the changed window 
dimensions. Thus, if the window is resized so that it is now 250 pixels wide
and 150 pixels high, the pixels will be addressed by _x_ in interval [0, 250) and
_y_ in interval [0, 150), where pixel (0,0) is the top left corner of
the window, i.e., the _y_ axis points _down_. 

Of course, if the window is resized, the original contents drawn so far will
be lost, and pyprocessing will automatically call the `draw()` function
you defined in your program, if any (see the next section).
